## Synopsis

For this challenge you will implement the Giant Bomb API to create an application that will allow a user to search games and "rent" them. The application should consist of at least two unique pages (`search` and `checkout`). Your view should display the game thumbnail and title, and the rest is up to you. You can use any language and or framework you'd like.
